This files marks I start to upload my personal developed codes to Github. I will gradually upload my personal developed code in C, Matlab, Python and perhapse in Fortran.

All uploaded code are not in conlfict with any other person.

The first time I know Python is when I was a PhD student in France. I had a Python class teaching us how to process signal using Python code.
